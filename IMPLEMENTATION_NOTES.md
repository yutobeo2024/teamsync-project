## Testing Checklist

### Authentication Flow
- [ ] Login as Admin user
- [ ] Access dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to create project

### Project Creation
- [ ] Fill project form
- [ ] Initiate Google OAuth
- [ ] Select existing sheet or create new
- [ ] Validate sheet structure
- [ ] Submit project creation
- [ ] Verify project appears in dashboard

### Google Sheets Integration
- [ ] OAuth popup opens correctly
- [ ] User sheets are listed
- [ ] Sheet validation works
- [ ] New sheet creation works
- [ ] Direct sheet links work

### Role-Based Access

## Architecture Alignment

This implementation aligns with the PRD and Architecture documents:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Database**: Google Sheets
- **OAuth**: Google OAuth2 for Sheets access
- **Styling**: Inline styles (consistent with existing code)

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. All acceptance criteria from Story 1.2 have been addressed:

1. ✅ Admin can create new projects
2. ✅ Google OAuth integration for Sheets access
3. ✅ Sheet selection and validation
4. ✅ New sheet creation with template
5. ✅ Project storage in Google Sheets
6. ✅ Dashboard integration
7. ✅ Role-based access control

The application is now ready for user testing and can proceed to the next user story.
